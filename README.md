# REPUBLIC Project

Code for Huygens ING project REPUBLIC (REsolutions PUBlished In a  
Compuational Environment). The project creates an online computational  
platform to access the Resolutions of the Dutch States General.

The Resolutions of the Dutch States General (1576-1796) constitute an archival series that covers more than two centuries of continuous decision making and consists of more than 500,000 pages, handwritten and printed resolutions, in separate, chronologically ordered series.

The Resolutions of the States General in the Dutch Republic are a key resource to the political history of this period as they contain all decisions made by the States General (SG), the central ruling body in the Republic. It was designated as a key resource when in 1905 the work of publishing the resolutions started (Japikse et al. 1915). The manual editing resulted in two series of analogue publications of (a selection of) the resolutions, divided in an old series (14 volumes running from 1576 – 1609), a new series (7 volumes, 1610 – 1625), and a [digital edition (1626-1630)](http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/retroboeken/statengeneraal).

The resolutions reveal the decision making process and are relevant for both high and low politics. They allow researchers to answer many different research questions about politics - but not only politics - in the Dutch Republic and its position in the world. The resolutions are also key to all the other records of the SG (about 1 mile) and form a backbone with which these other records can be connected and contextualised.
