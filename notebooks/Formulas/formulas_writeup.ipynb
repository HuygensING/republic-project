    "When we started the REPUBLIC project, the idea was all along that we we would have to use as much information as available in the corpus itself. THe guiding rule was that as much would have to be done automatically as possible, while keeping humans in the loop for direction and correction. \n",

    "1. by year, \n",
    "2. by volume (sometimes several volumes per year, but always an index per year), \n",
    "3. by session, usually a session day and \n",
    "4. by resolutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Presumably for reasons of both convention and findability these elements were recognizable on a page.\n",

    "The use of formulas is another feature that served many of the same reasons and additionally served both the ease of the clerks and the need to express important elements of the resolutions unequivocally. For readers these formulaic expressions are tedious, but they allow readers to quickly find important passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have identified and used some of these formulas already to structure the resolutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The opening of a resolution is by way of a so called proposition in which its reason was stipulated. This included the receipt of a letter, a request, a report etc. \n",
    "- days on which there was no session were invariably indicated with 'nihil actum' (no actions), usually with the reason (mostly Sundays or holidays)\n",
    "- resolutions had several types of decisions: \n",
    "    - _no decision_ ('waar op geen resolutie is genomen'), \n",
    "    - _positive_ (e.g. 'is goedgevonden en verstaan'), \n",
    "    - _negative_ or \n",
    "    - _qualified decision_. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Often actions the decision was followed by the actions that it caused. For instance, a committee of delegates from the council would get a commission to investigate further into the matter. For this several more or less fixed formulas were used.\n",
    "- the middle part was called the _deliberation_ ('deliberatie') and usually contains and expose of the issue at stake and the points on which a decision had to be taken. Due to the varied nature of the deliberation, this is not characterized by strict formulas. "

    "The term formulaic expressions may seem to indicate a fixed sequence of words, but in fact they are not. \n",
    "1. There is the practical issue that early modern texts have a lot of orthographic variation. This is complicated by our dependence on OCR and HTR for converting contemporary printed and manuscript text to machine readable text. While OCR and especially HTR have improved much over the last decade, the best results still have character error rates of 1-5 percent, which means that the word error rate is a bit higher.\n",
    "1. Formulaic expressions contain a lot of variation. What to a human seems repitition, to a computer is not. This ranges from slight variation in phrases, to grammatical changes due to for instance plural and singular. The subject of a formula may also change. For instance, a proposition may contain _\"Ontvangen/Gelezen/Gehoord een missive/request/rapport van\"_ (EN:_\"Received/Read/Heard a missive/request/report from\"_). When we compare different instances of a formula this variation will almost always only have constant parts in function words (_de, een, sal, werden_, etc) "

The fuzzy-search library is very well suited for dealing with small variants, but slows down with many large phrases\n",
